## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data using **Excel** tools such as **VLOOKUP**, **Pivot Tables**, **Charts**, and **Slicers** to gain insights into different sales metrics.

### 🔹 Merging Data
The first step was to combine datasets using `VLOOKUP` to bring in `Region`, `Income Group`, and `Amount` from the details sheet. Below is a preview of the merged dataset:

## 🚀 Features Implemented
✅ **Pivot Tables**:
- Sales by **Category and Region**.
- Sales by **Income Group, Category, and Region**.
- Sales by **Month, Quarter, and Year** (with filters for Category & Region).
- **Age Grouping**: Created age bands (e.g., 20-40, 40-60) using calculated columns.
- **Average Sales by Age Group**.
✅ **Data Visualization**:
- Created **charts** for better representation of sales trends.
- Implemented **Slicers** for interactive filtering.

### 📊 Sales Trends Over Time
To analyze trends, a pivot table was created to show **Sales by Month, Quarter, and Year**, using **Category and Region as filters**:

## 📊 Data Insights
- Germany's sales are limited to the **Adult (35-64) age group**.
- Canada's sales are focused only on the **Young Adult (25-34) age group**.
- Other key observations can be drawn from the interactive charts and Pivot Tables.

### 📋 Answering Business Questions
For **Question C**, a pivot table was designed to display sales based on **Month, Quarter, and Year** while using **Category and Region as filters**:
